        // Comments Mateja:
        // There's been a kick out of some of the sites over time since the original 2015 publication, original arrays were called 390k (panel 1) 
        // and 390k_supplement (panel2). The sites were merged for popgen and kept separate from the big Yoruba (panel 3) and archaic admixture (panel 4) 
        // and called 1240k. Then they were merged also physically in the lab to form one array - primarily in Boston and Jena. 
        // Over time some sites were kicked out from the bed file compared to the original 390k+390k supplement (AA87-88_AA116-119), 
        // my understanding for this was that for whatever reason some sites were never successful in being captured in the lab (both Boston and Jena). 
        // That's how the current "original 1240k" bed/AADR sites/"1240k" was born. So should be the 390k+390k supplement, but in reality it's a bit smaller
