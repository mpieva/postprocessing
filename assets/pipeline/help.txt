Run the pipeline by providing a directory of demultiplexed BAM files with the --split flag

nextflow run /mnt/scratch/merlin/software/run_postprocessing_pipeline/main.nf --split SPLIT

// analyzeBAM (Yanivs C++ rewrite)

bamfilter_minlength      N        Minimum length of retained sequences (default: 35)
bamfilter_minqual        N        Minimum mapping quality of retained sequences (default: 25)
bamfilter_targetfile     PATH     A targetfile for analyzeBAM (not tested)

bamrmdup_cheap                    Cheap computation: skip the consensus calling
bamrmdup_circular        CHR:LEN  CHR is circular with length LEN

The pipeline runs using singularity as container software
